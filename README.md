# Snobol4CS
Snobol4CS - A Snobol4 interpreter written in C#

I learned Snobol4 in high school in 1971. When I went to college I wrote a Snobol4 program for sybolic math 
to quickly no my calculus homework. I have been a fan of the language ever since, and I have wanted to do 
what I can to keep the language alive. Although there are packages that implement Snobol4's pattern matching
using object oriented languages, they are not interpters. 

This project is a Snobol4 interpeter written in C#. THe intepreter uses an object oriented design. This is 
not an objected oriented version of Snobol4 but an interpreter for standard Snobol4. I consider Phil Budne's
SIL Snobol4 written in C to be the "standard." 

So far, the uploaded code will take Snobol4 statements and convert them to a reverse polish stack based 
intermediate language. (Not SIL.) After more testing of this code, I will add the intermediate language 
interpretern.
